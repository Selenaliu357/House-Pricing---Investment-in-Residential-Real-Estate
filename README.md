Overview
This project analyzes a King County housing dataset to understand key drivers of sale price and build predictive models. We explore both linear and non-linear relationships, perform feature engineering, and evaluate model performance with and without regularization.

Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning
2. EDA & Visualization
3. Baseline Models
4. Expanded Models
5. Polynomial & Regularized Models

Findings
1. Square footage is the strongest single predictor.
2. Bed count adds incremental explanatory power.
3. Polynomial features capture non-linear effects and interactions, boosting fitâ€”but risk overfitting.
4. Ridge regularization balances complexity, improving out-of-sample performance.
